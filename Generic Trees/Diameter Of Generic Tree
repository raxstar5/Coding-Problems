Diameter Of Generic Tree

Medium

1. You are given a partially written GenericTree class.
2. You are required to find and print the diameter of tree. THe diameter is defined as maximum number of edges between any two nodes in the tree

#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Node {
    public:
    int data;
    vector<Node*>children;
};

int dia = 0;
int diameter(Node* root){ 

     int dch = -1;
     int sdch = -1;

    for(int i = 0; i < root->children.size(); i++){
         int ch = diameter(root->children[i]);
         if(ch > dch){
             sdch = dch;
             dch = ch;
         }
         else if( ch > sdch){
             sdch = ch;
         }
    }

    int cand = sdch + dch + 2;
    if(cand > dia){
         dia = cand;
     }
    dch+=1;
    return dch;
}
