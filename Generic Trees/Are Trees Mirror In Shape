Problem Statement:
Are Trees Mirror In Shape

1. You are given a partially written GenericTree class.
2. You are required to complete the body of areMirror function. 
The function is expected to check if the two trees passed to it are mirror images of each other in shape (data not to be checked, just the shape of tree).

class Node
{
public:
  int data = 0;
  vector<Node *> children;

  Node(int data)
  {
    this->data = data;
  }
};


bool mirrorShape(Node *n1, Node *n2) 
{
    
    if(n1->children.size() != n2->children.size()){
        return false;
    }

    for(int i = 0; i < n1->children.size()/2; i++){

      bool recans = mirrorShape(n1->children[i], n2->children[n2->children.size()-1-i]);
      if(recans == false) {
          return false;
      }
    }
    return true;    
}
